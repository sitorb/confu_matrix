# **Classification Model Evaluation **

## **Overview**
This project evaluates the performance of a classification model using various machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of multiple classes, and the goal is to build a robust model that accurately classifies new data points.

Key techniques used in this project:
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding, and cleaning)
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics analysis (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy)
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Performance tuning and insights

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## **Installation**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classification-project.git
$ cd classification-project
```

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

## **Usage**
### **1. Open Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```
### **2. Load and Run the Notebook**
- Open `confu_matrix.ipynb`
- Run all cells to train and evaluate the model

## **Model Evaluation**
### **1. Classification Report**
| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| 0     | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00    | 10      |
| 1     | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00    | 9       |
| 2     | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00    | 11      |

**Metrics Explanation:**
- **Precision**: Measures how many of the predicted labels were actually correct.
- **Recall**: Measures how many of the actual labels were correctly predicted.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model, which is 100% in this case.

### **2. Confusion Matrix Visualization**
A heatmap is used to display the confusion matrix, showing that the model made no incorrect predictions.

### **3. Precision, Recall, and F1-score Bar Chart**
A bar chart compares the modelâ€™s performance across different classes, confirming that all scores are perfect.

## **Future Improvements**
- Testing on a larger dataset to ensure the model generalizes well.
- Experimenting with different classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
- Introducing regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
